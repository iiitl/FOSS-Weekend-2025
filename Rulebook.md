## PR Point System

Your contributions will be evaluated and assigned points based on the following system:

### Base Points:
- **Mandatory PR Submission**: 5 pts
- **Easy Issue PR**: 10 pts
- **Medium Issue PR**: 20 pts
- **Hard Issue PR**: 30 pts
- **Valid Issue Raised**: 5 pts (If you raise a valid issue, even if you donâ€™t submit a PR, you receive 5 points if the issue is valid)

### Special Repo PR Bonus (For Student-Hub, MessEase, Github-bot and SequriQuest Only)
- These repositories are intended for future use by students, making them high-value projects.
- **Special Repository PR Bonus**: Up to 10 additional pts (Only on medium and hard issues)

### Quality Bonus (Up to 10 pts):
You can earn extra points based on the quality of your PR.

## Repository Types
Repositories are categorized as follows:

### 1. Multiple PRs Allowed on a Single Issue
- Multiple contributors can submit PRs for the same issue.
- PRs will be closed after review, and points will be given accordingly.
- **No assignment is required** in these repositories.
- Tagged as `Muliple-PR` in readme.md

### 2. Single PR Per Issue
- Only one PR is allowed per issue.
- The PR will be merged after review, and points will be assigned.
- The bot will be active here, and **assignment is required** to work on an issue.
- Tagged as `Unique-PR` in readme.md

## Issue Assignment System
- To assign yourself an issue, comment `/assign`.
- To unassign yourself, comment `/unassign`.
- A contributor can assign themselves a maximum of **three issues at a time**.
- You can only assign additional issues if your previous assigned issues are closed.
- If two people have already raised PRs before the assignment time, the third person should wait until the maintainer reviews the previous PRs before assigning the issue to themselves.
- Time limits for issue completion based on difficulty:
  - **Easy Issue**: 1.5 hours
  - **Medium Issue**: 3 hours
  - **Hard Issue**: 5 hours
  - **No label**: Considered **Medium Issue** (3 hours)
- If you need more time due to substantial work done, you can request the maintainer to increase the time.
- **Note**: Extensions are given only when necessary and only when you have shown what you have done , so assign issue only if you can work on it.

## Leaderboard System
- The leaderboard tracks contributions via labels.
- The leaderboard is updated every 30 mins, so don't dm maintainers that i haven't got points.

# Contributor Rulebook

Welcome to the contribution guidelines! This document outlines the rules and processes for contributing to the project effectively.

## PR Point System

Your contributions will be evaluated and assigned points based on the following system:

### Base Points:
- **Mandatory PR Submission**: 5 pts
- **Easy Issue PR**: 10 pts
- **Medium Issue PR**: 20 pts
- **Hard Issue PR**: 30 pts
- **Valid Issue Raised**: 5 pts (If you raise a valid issue, even if you donâ€™t submit a PR, you receive 5 points if the issue is valid)

### Special Repo PR Bonus (For Student-Hub, MessEase, and SequriQuest Only)
- These repositories are intended for future use by students, making them high-value projects.
- **Special Repository PR Bonus**: Up to 10 additional pts (Only on medium and hard issues)

### Quality Bonus (Up to 10 pts):
You can earn extra points based on the quality of your PR:
- **PR Description**: 2 pts (Clear and informative description)
- **Quality of PR**: 4 pts (Well-structured, clean code, proper formatting, and follows best practices)
- **Commit Message**: 2 pts (Meaningful and concise commit messages)
- **Commit History is Clear**: 2 pts (No unnecessary commits, properly squashed commits when needed)

## Repository Types
Repositories are categorized as follows:

### 1. Multiple PRs Allowed on a Single Issue
- Multiple contributors can submit PRs for the same issue.
- PRs will be closed after review, and points will be given accordingly.
- **No assignment is required** in these repositories.

### 2. Single PR Per Issue
- Only one PR is allowed per issue.
- The PR will be merged after review, and points will be assigned.
- The bot will be active here, and **assignment is required** to work on an issue.

## Issue Assignment System
- To assign yourself an issue, comment `/assign`.
- To unassign yourself, comment `/unassign`.
- Time limits for issue completion based on difficulty:
  - **Easy Issue**: 1.5 hours
  - **Medium Issue**: 3 hours
  - **Hard Issue**: 5 hours
  - **No label**: Considered **Medium Issue** (3 hours)
- If you need more time due to substantial work done, the maintainer can extend the deadline by commenting `/extend-'time in hrs here'` (e.g., `/extend-2`).
- **Note**: Extensions are given only when necessary.

## Leaderboard System
- The leaderboard tracks contributions via labels.
- Once a PR is accepted, the maintainer **must** add a label in the format: `accepted-'points here'` (e.g., `accepted-30`).
- The label **must be in lowercase** so that the leaderboard bot can recognize it.

## Contributor Responsibilities
- **Follow Contribution Guidelines**: Ensure that your code follows best practices and project rules.
- **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Keep commit messages meaningful and concise.
- **Use Proper Branching**: Work on a separate branch before making a PR.
- **Respect Deadlines**: Complete issues within the given timeframe.
- **Engage with Maintainers**: If a PR needs improvement, make necessary changes promptly.
- **Label PRs Properly**: Ensure that PRs have the correct labels so they are processed efficiently.

## Setup Guidelines
- Ensure that you follow the setup guide provided in the **README**.
- If environment variables are required, check for a `.env.example` file to configure them correctly.

For further assistance, contact **the maintainers** or **FOSS-Wing@Axios**.

Happy Contributing!

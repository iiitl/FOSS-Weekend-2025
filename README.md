3. **Submit a pull request** that merges your branch into the repositoryâ€™s main branch.  
4. Work on issues or follow the instructions mentioned in the README of the participating projects.

## Special Instructions for Hard-Labeled Issues  

- If an issue is labeled **hard**, request assignment before starting work.  
- Only **3 participants** will be assigned per issue on a first-come, first-served basis.  
- Each participant must submit a PR **within 3 hours** of assignment. (Extensions may be granted if needed.)  
- If you realize you can't complete the issue, **unassign yourself** and leave a comment so others can take over.

## Good Practices (Must Read Before Starting)  

âœ” **Write clear and concise pull request descriptions**  
   - Explain the changes you made and their impact.  
   - Include screenshots, GIFs, or short videos if possible.  

âœ” **Mention issue numbers**  
   - When creating a PR, reference the issue number (e.g., `fixes #123`) to automatically close it when merged.  

âœ” **Use descriptive and concise commit messages**  
   - Summarize the changes made in each commit, including issue numbers if applicable.  

âœ” **Create separate branches for new features**  
   - Always create a new branch from `main/master` for each new feature or bug fix.  

âœ” **Regularly merge from the main branch**  
   - Keep your branch up-to-date by merging changes from the main branch into your feature branch.

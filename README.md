## Good Practices (Must Read Before Starting)  

✔ **Write clear and concise pull request descriptions**  
   - Explain the changes you made and their impact.  
   - Include screenshots, GIFs, or short videos if possible.  

✔ **Mention issue numbers**  
   - When creating a PR, reference the issue number (e.g., `fixes #123`) to automatically close it when merged.  

✔ **Use descriptive and concise commit messages**  
   - Summarize the changes made in each commit, including issue numbers if applicable.  

✔ **Create separate branches for new features**  
   - Always create a new branch from `main/master` for each new feature or bug fix.  

✔ **Regularly merge from the main branch**  
   - Keep your branch up-to-date by merging changes from the main branch into your feature branch.
